# Challenge_Response_Kiosk
Extending SUI's Kiosk for a challenge response protocol.

The necessity to have such an extension arose during the [SUIxBSA hackathon](https://sui-bsa-hackathon.devfolio.co/projects) at EPFL, when we were building the [SuiSeal](https://github.com/TUM-Blockchain-Club/SuiSeal) Application. 
This is a polished version of the hackathon implementation.
